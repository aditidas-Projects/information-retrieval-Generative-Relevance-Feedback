The move came after nearly three years of neutrality, as American public opinion slowly began to turn in favor of intervention.\n\nThe United States had initially hoped to stay out of the conflict, which began in 1914. But as the war dragged on, and as reports of atrocities mounted, American opinion began to change. President Woodrow Wilson, who had been elected in 1916 on a platform of keeping the United States out of the war, eventually came to believe that American intervention was necessary to make the world \"safe for democracy.\"\n\nIn early 1917, Germany made a move that finally tipped the scales in favor of intervention. The country announced that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare, sinking any ship that entered war zones, regardless of whether it was carrying civilians or munitions. This move, coupled with the Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany proposed a military alliance with Mexico, led to a major shift in American public opinion.\n\nOn April 2, 1917, Wilson went before Congress and asked for a declaration of war. The resolution passed on April 6, and the United States formally entered World War I.",
