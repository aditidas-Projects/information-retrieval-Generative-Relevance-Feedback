# Information-Retrieval-Generative-Relevance-Feedback
This provides the code and input files for our endsem project on Generative Relevance Feedback as a part of our course, IT550 Information Retrieval.

Please make sure to go through the directory paths if using it and make sure that you have the correct directory for the files highlighted in the image along with this repository.

P.S We did not end up using the alternate queries prompt generated by BARD when calculating the change in values due to all documents. Neither did we use the domain objects queries generated by GPT.

For more details on the project, check out the ```pdf``` file which contains a detailed description of the project along with the obtained results. The ```ppt``` file contains all the results which we have obtained.
